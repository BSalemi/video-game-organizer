Welcome to the Video Game Organizer Sinatra app!

This app allows users to keep track of the video games they own as well as add new video games to the database.

To use, first run 'bundle install' to make sure all necessary gems are installed.

Once bundle is complete, run 'shotgun' to activate your local server. Sign up using an email address and creating a valid username and password. Once created, follow the links to Edit your Account, Add a Game to the Database, or view the Games that are already in the Database. 

While navigating, if you come to a page of a Game that you own, click the "Add Game to Your Collection" link to add the game to your profile. Continue to follow the links to explore the rest of the page and find games sorted by system, company, and content rating. 

When you're finished, simply click the Log Out link to log out of the app. Enjoy!
